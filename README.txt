Machine Learning Specialisation Deeplearning.ai

This repo consists of my notes for 5 consective courses I recommend for beginners to learn about deep learning. These are listed below as following:

1. Machine Learning Specialisation
2. Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science
3. Deep Learning Specialisation
4. Tensorflow Developer Professional Certificate
5. Tensorflow: Advanced techniques Specialisation

These courses are free on https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/

These courses were recommended to me by one of my brilliant lecturer Yangchen Pan (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4M4pOp4AAAAJ&hl=en) after taking his 
week long course in ML with Python (my notes to that course are also on my github repos page).
